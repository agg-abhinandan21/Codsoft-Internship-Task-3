ðŸ”’ CodSoft Internship Task 3 Completed!

ðŸ”¹ Project: Password Generator in Python

I'm excited to share that I've completed my third task during the CodSoft Internship Program â€” a secure password generator built using Python.

ðŸ§  What I Implemented:

âœ… User-defined password length

âœ… Option to include letters, digits, and special characters

âœ… Randomized secure password generation

âœ… Input validation for user-friendly experience

ðŸ’¡ This project helped me strengthen my logic-building skills and explore Python's string and random libraries for real-world use cases.

Looking forward to more exciting challenges ahead! ðŸš€
